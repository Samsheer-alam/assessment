Here are some of the ways using which we can handle millions of user
1. Database optimization: indexing the required fields
2. Load balancing: distribute the workload across multiple servers, which will ensure that the application is not overloaded with too many requests and can handle a large number of users.
3. Caching: By caching frequently accessed data, we can reduce the number of requests made to the database, resulting in faster response times.
4. Horizontal Scaling: adding more servers to the system as the user base grows.
